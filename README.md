# discordr
This is library to make [Discord](discord.com) bots in R.

R may not be the best language for writing discord bots but it widely used in the scientific community.
At the same time discord use is expanding, hence the idea of this library to be able to write simple bots in R.

# Status

The library is still in a very early development phase and so far many features (and documentation) are missing.
